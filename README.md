php-ffprobe
===========

PHP wrapper class for `ffprobe` media prober.

This simple class was born [as a response](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11807265/222758) on StackOverflow.

I had plans to further improve it a lot and release as a Composer package, but in the mean time I began to be very busy at work and had no time to continue.

Luckily, at the daily rush I found the project [PHP-FFMpeg](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg) which is far beyond anything that I had planned to do.
Since I'm using this great package in my projects, I have plans to be contributing on it to make it even better to the community. I strongly recommend it!

And if you want to make your own wrapper for `ffprobe`, this base class should help you get a start. :)
